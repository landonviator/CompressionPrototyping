# Agro Compressor

## An aggressive compressor I made experimenting with the JUCE compressor DSP class. Intended for transient-heavy signals like drums, it adds an aggressive pop to the sound source. It automatically attenuates the gain as you change the compress and edge knobs. Dial in more or less input to drive the compressor even harder! You might even get some saturation out of it ;)
